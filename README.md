# Java Computer Games

## Purpose
This repository showcases games created using the Java programming language. The creation of these games help instill and reinforce basic Java concepts. Anyone who wants to learn Java should purchase "Do-It-Yourself Java Games" by Annette Godland ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Do-Yourself-Java-Games-Introduction/dp/1518789137/ref=sr_1_1?crid=217K3ME0E72J7&keywords=do-it-yourself+java&qid=1661648472&sprefix=do-it-yourself+java%2Caps%2C695&sr=8-1)). Be sure to not copy and paste the code from a site you find online. Deligently type the code directly from the book so that you can more effectively absorb the concepts. Good luck!

# Java Computer Games

## Purpose
This repository showcases games created using the Java programming language. The creation of these games help instill and reinforce basic Java concepts. Anyone who wants to learn Java should purchase "Do-It-Yourself Java Games" by Annette Godland ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Do-Yourself-Java-Games-Introduction/dp/1518789137/ref=sr_1_1?crid=217K3ME0E72J7&keywords=do-it-yourself+java&qid=1661648472&sprefix=do-it-yourself+java%2Caps%2C695&sr=8-1)). Be sure to not copy and paste the code from a site you find online. Deligently type the code directly from the book so that you can more effectively absorb the concepts. Good luck! 

In each project folder, there is a directory called "z_Eclipse." Each game was first created in the development environment known as Eclispse. The games were then copied and pasted onto VS Code so that they could be pushed to this directory. The code for the games are located in the src directory. They are in .java files. The src directories in Projects 9, 10, 14, 15, and 16 each have a .jar file. Download the .jar file to play the actual game.
